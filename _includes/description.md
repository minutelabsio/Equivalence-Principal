We've sent the MinutePhysics sheep into space to investigate the effects of non-inertial reference frames! In our case, that's a fancy way of saying: "accelerating rocket". You'll be able to see the **Equivalence Principle** in action. The Space Sheep will feel like they are under the effects of a gravitational field when the rocket is accelerating.

Henry briefly talked about the <a href="http://youtu.be/VS46DZe5usY" target="_blank">Equivalence Principle in his latest video which you can watch on YouTube</a>. It's the idea that the effects of acceleration in one reference frame can appear as a gravitational force in another.
