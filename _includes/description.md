We've sent the MinutePhysics sheep into space to investigate the effects of non-inertial reference frames! In our case, that's a fancy way of saying: "accelerating rocket". You'll be able to see the **Equivalence Principle** in action. The Space Sheep will feel like they are under the effects of a gravitational field when the rocket is accelerating.

Henry described the <a href="" target="_blank">Equivalence Principle in his latest video which you can watch on YouTube</a>.
